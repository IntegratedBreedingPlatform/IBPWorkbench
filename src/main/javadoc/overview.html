<h3>Welcome to the IBP Middleware Documentation.</h3>

<h4>Adding Middleware as a dependency of your project</h4>

<p>
It is recommended to use Apache Maven.  Add the following to your list of dependencies:</br>
</br>
<code>
groupId: org.generationcp</br>
artifactId: middleware</br>
version: 1.0.0</br>
</code>
</br>
Take note of the version.  Use of the latest version is recommended.</br>
The latest version as of April 25, 2012: 0.3.0
</p>
<p>
Right now, the Middleware is not yet deployed to any online Maven repository.  Users have to checkout
the project from the maven repository and manually install the project's jar into the local
maven repository.  This is done by simply running "mvn clean install" command while on the
home directory of the project.  To skip JUnit tests, use this command: "mvn -DskipTests=true clean install".
</p>
<p>
If you do not want to use Maven, you can get a jar of the Middleware project by sending a request to Kevin
Manansala (kevin@efficio.us.com).
</p>

<h4>Checking out the Middleware Project</h4>
<p>
The project is stored in the SVN repository hosted at gcp.efficio.us.com.  The URL for the repository is: 
http://gcp.efficio.us.com/svn/.  An anonymous account may be used to checkout the project.  The 
username is "efficio" and the password is "3ff1ci000".
</p>

<h4>Using the Middleware</h4>
<p>
Follow the steps below to instantiate Manager classes and use their functions:
</p>
<p>
1. Create a ManagerFactory instance.</br>
</br>
A ManagerFactory instance produces the Manager objects you can use in your application.
Creation of the ManagerFactory includes opening a connection to the database specified
by the DatabaseConnectionParameters.  The ManagerFactory accepts two DatabaseConnectionParameters 
objects as parameters.  The first is used to connect to a local instance of IBDB and
the second is used to connect to a central instance of IBDB.  The user can provide both 
or can provide one of the two.
</br>
Sample code:</br>
</br>
<code>
DatabaseConnectionParameters params = new DatabaseConnectionParameters("localhost", "3306", "dbname", 
					"username", "password");</br>
ManagerFactory factory = new ManagerFactory(params, null);<br>
<br>
1. creating a ManagerFactory which uses connections to both local and central instances</br>
</br>
DatabaseConnectionParameters local = new DatabaseConnectionParameters(...);</br>
DatabaseConnectionParameters central = new DatabaseConnectionParameters(...);</br>
ManagerFactory factory = new ManagerFactory(local, central);</br>
</br>
2. creating a ManagerFactory which uses a connection to local only</br>
</br>
DatabaseConnectionParameters local = new DatabaseConnectionParameters(...);</br>
ManagerFactory factory = new ManagerFactory(local, null);</br>
</br>
3. creating a ManagerFactory which uses a connection to central only</br>
</br>
DatabaseConnectionParameters central = new DatabaseConnectionParameters(...);</br>
ManagerFactory factory = new ManagerFactory(null, central);</br>
</br>
</code>
</p>
<p>
2. Call the getter method for the Manager object you want to use.</br>
</br>
In the example below, I am interested in retrieving Germplasm data so I need a 
GermplasmDataManager object.</br>
</br>
Sample code:</br>
</br>
<code>
GermplasmDataManager manager = factory.getGermplasmDataManager();
</code>
</p>
<p>
3. Call the function of the Manager object you want to use.</br>
</br>
Sample code:</br>
</br>
<code>
Germplasm germplasm = manager.getGermplasmByGID(new Integer(50533));</br>
System.out.println(germplasm);
</code>
</p>
<p>
The way the methods of the Manager implementation classes work depends on the available connection/s given by
the ManagerFactory.  Some methods work with a connection to a local instance only.  Some methods retrieve
results from both connections, local and central.  The methods will throw a QueryException when they have
a problem with the connection passed to them.
</p>
<h4>Running JUnit tests</h4>

<p>
1. To run the JUnit tests in the project, you need: Java, Maven, and an IBDB database you can connect 
to.  The current schema tested right now is the ICIS 5.5 schema, in the future versions of
the IBDB schema will be tested.</br>
</br>
2. Create a file named "testDatabaseConfig.properties" in the src/test/resources folder of the project.
The content of the file should be like this:</br>
</br>
local.host = localhost</br>
local.port = 3306</br>
local.dbname = dbname</br>
local.username = user</br>
local.password = password</br>
</br>
central.host = localhost</br>
central.port = 3306</br>
central.dbname = dbname</br>
central.username = user</br>
central.password = password</br>
</br>
Set the correct values for your set-up of the databases.</br>
</br>
3. Navigate to the root directory of the project and run the command: mvn clean test.  You can also
limit the test class to run by using the option "-Dtest=TestClassName", for example:
mvn clean test -Dtest=TestGermplasmDataManagerImpl</br>
</br>
</p>
