===================
Running JUnit tests
===================

1. To run the JUnit tests in the project, you need: Java, Maven, and an IBDB database you can connect 
to.  The current schema tested right now is the ICIS 5.5 schema, in the future versions of
the IBDB schema will be tested.

2. Edit the file named "test-hibernate.cfg.xml" in the src/test/resources folder of the project.
Change the values for url, username, password, default_schema properties, replacing them
with values which reflect your setup.

3. Navigate to the root directory of the project and run the command: mvn clean test.  You can also
limit the test class to run by using the option "-Dtest=TestClassName", for example:
mvn clean test -Dtest=TestGermplasmDataManagerImpl
