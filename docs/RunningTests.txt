===================
Running JUnit tests
===================

1. To run the JUnit tests in the project, you need: Java, Maven, and an IBDB database you can connect 
to.  The current schema tested right now is the ICIS 5.5 schema, in the future versions of
the IBDB schema will be tested.

2. Create a file named "testDatabaseConfig.properties" in the src/test/resources folder of the project.
The content of the file should be like this:

local.host = localhost
local.port = 3306
local.dbname = dbname
local.username = user
local.password = password

central.host = localhost
central.port = 3306
central.dbname = dbname
central.username = user
central.password = password

Set the correct values for your set-up of the databases.


3. Navigate to the root directory of the project and run the command: mvn clean test.  You can also
limit the test class to run by using the option "-Dtest=TestClassName", for example:
mvn clean test -Dtest=TestGermplasmDataManagerImpl
