Using the Middleware
====================

Follow the steps below to instantiate Manager classes and use their functions:

1. Create a ManagerFactory instance.

A ManagerFactory instance produces the Manager objects you can use in your application.
Creation of the ManagerFactory included opening a connection to the database specified
by the DatabaseConnectionParameters.

Sample code:

DatabaseConnectionParameters params = new DatabaseConnectionParameters("localhost", "3306", "dbname", 
					"username", "password");
ManagerFactory factory = new ManagerFactory(params);

2. Call the getter method for the Manager object you want to use.

In the example below, I am interested in retrieving Germplasm data so I need a 
GermplasmDataManager object.

Sample code:

GermplasmDataManager manager = factory.getGermplasmDataManager();

3. Call the function of the Manager object you want to use.

Sample code:

Germplasm germplasm = manager.getGermplasmByGID(new Integer(50533));
System.out.println(germplasm);
